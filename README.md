# Front-End Engineer Coding Challenge

Coding challenge to demonstrate JS skills and how I worked with the data provided.

The final result can be found here: [https://book-site-frontend-challenge.web.app/](https://book-site-frontend-challenge.web.app/).

The app is routed but will re-route you on load to the `/products/productId` route (with the demo ID) as this is the key page of the project.

The app is deployed using Google Firebase.

## The Challenge 🔥

The challenge was to create a "product details page" using json data from an API provided by Supadu.

The page was to contain the following information:

- Title ✔️
- Contributor/Author ✔️
- Contributor bio ✔️
- Image ✔️
- Description ✔️
- Prices ✔️
- Sale Date ✔️
- Reviews ✔️
- Retailer links ✔️

The project was to be built using one of the following:

1. WordPress ❌
2. Vanilla PHP ❌
3. A JS framework (VueJS preferable) ✔️

As the assessment was designed to demonstrate my JavaScript skills and how I worked with the data provided I decided that it would be best to use a JS framework rather than either of the two PHP-based options. (Also in this instance as it's working with API data - WordPress seems a bit overkill).

As I've been doing a lot of personal projects in React.js I decided that this would be the best framework to use in this instance. As i've not used Vue.js properly for a while and React was fresh in my mind it made the most sense to do the project in that framework - to be able to more easily show my JS skills.

## The Review 👓

Each applicant of the challenge would be rated on the following: 

- Fully responsive page
- Intuitive design and layout
- Sufficient data handling and formatting
- Clean readable layout and styles
- Accessibility features are a bonus

## The Result 🌐

Because of the time constraints I kept the design / layout very plain - this was to be able to spend more time on the JS aspects of the project. I also don't claim to be a designer - while I can work from designs provided my own design skills are limited.

Having more time on the project or in a production setting I would update the design and add some additional styling and animation. I would also include a Header / Footer and style the 404 page.



## The Action ⚡

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
